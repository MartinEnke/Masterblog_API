Hi Nhung,
unfortunately i ran into some problems.
First of all, I don't get the program to work within codio.
I disabled the limiters because codio had problems with them, i believe.
But still it doesn't open in the Open API Applictaion, only brings a 502.
Besides that my program has a bug. Logged in users can't add, edit and delete their own posts.
I tried hours with DevTools, Inspect and ChatGPT, but ended up going in circles.
Sometimes the problem is fetching, according to error-messages, sometimes its authentication.
I still learned a lot while trying to debug it but would have wished to find it out. ;)
Would be great if you know what's going on.


Best Martin
