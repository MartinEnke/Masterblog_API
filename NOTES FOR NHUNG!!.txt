Hi Nhung,
at some point it worked just fine to log in, and as logged in user to add, edit or delete
your own posts. Unfortunately, there is some authentication issue, with this token system
which I couldn't figure out. :(
It would be so great if you know what the problem is ;)
It tool me ages to do all this, but the main functionality doesn't work anymore. :/

Thanks in advance!

Best Martin
