🎧 Spotify
🔧 Backend Tech:
Primary Language: Java and Python
API Layer: RESTful APIs and some gRPC microservices
API Management: Homegrown infrastructure + API Gateway
Authentication: OAuth 2.0

🧠 Fun Fact:
Spotify uses over 1,000 microservices to power features.
Their Web API is exposed for developers (e.g. for playlists, tracks, user data)
but internally they use much faster gRPC for service-to-service communication.

🎬 Netflix
🔧 Backend Tech:
Primary Language: Java, Python, Node.js, Golang
API Framework: Netflix pioneered GraphQL with Falcor, but also uses REST
Infrastructure: Hosted on AWS, with heavy use of Kubernetes and Zuul (API gateway)
Authentication: JWT & OAuth 2.0

🧠 Fun Fact:
Netflix moved from a monolith to a microservice architecture early on.
Their API Gateway handles things like A/B testing, personalization, device optimization, etc.

🐦 Twitter / X
🔧 Backend Tech:
Primary Language: Scala (replaced much of their original Ruby code)
API Type: RESTful APIs + Streaming APIs (for real-time feeds)
Frameworks: Finagle (Scala-based microservice framework by Twitter)
Authentication: OAuth 1.0a (for legacy reasons) and OAuth 2.0

🧠 Fun Fact:
Twitter's Streaming API once powered real-time dashboards like TweetDeck.
They’ve scaled out internal services massively to deal with billions of tweets daily.

🔁 Common Patterns
Feature	                 Used By
REST + JSON APIs	     All of them
OAuth 2.0	             Spotify, Netflix, Twitter
Microservices	         All
API Gateway	             Netflix (Zuul), Spotify
gRPC/GraphQL	         Netflix (Falcor), Spotify
Custom Rate Limiting     Twitter & Spotify

🧪 TL;DR:
These companies use scalable, secure, and modular backends powered by:
REST or GraphQL APIs
Authentication via OAuth
Microservices architecture
Languages like Java, Scala, Python, and Go



🐍 Flask — The Minimalist Veteran
✅ Strengths:
Lightweight & Flexible: You build only what you need.
Perfect for small/medium projects or quick MVPs.
Has a huge community and tons of plugins (e.g., Flask-JWT, Flask-Limiter, Flask-SQLAlchemy).
Battle-tested since 2010.

🧱 In Big Tech?
Rarely used directly for very large-scale systems (like Netflix), but it’s awesome for:
Admin tools
Dashboards
Prototyping
Internal microservices


⚡ FastAPI — The Speed Demon with Modern Perks
✅ Strengths:
Built for APIs, not general-purpose web apps.
Blazing fast (thanks to Starlette and async support).
Uses Python type hints for:
Autogenerated docs (Swagger & ReDoc)
Data validation
IDE autocompletion
Async-ready for high concurrency.
Better for APIs from day one compared to Flask.

🚀 FastAPI
Released in 2019, so relatively young — BUT it’s:
Adopted by Netflix, Microsoft, Uber, Airbyte, DocuSign, and others
Maintained actively and gaining maturity
Backed by the Python Software Foundation

🧱 In Big Tech?
More and more companies are using it in production for:
API gateways
Async-heavy services
Data ingestion pipelines
Lightweight microservices

🧠 When Should You Switch to FastAPI?
🚦 Consider Switching to FastAPI if…
🔁 You want to build fully async endpoints for better performance
📊 You're planning to scale up — many concurrent API users
🔐 You want built-in request validation, type safety, and Swagger docs
🔗 You want your API to be highly structured and self-documented
🧪 You want fast autotesting with strong type inference
⚡ You're building data APIs or integrating with other services
🧱 You're building a public-facing API with external consumers
🏁 When is Flask Perfectly Fine?
✅ Stick with Flask if…
🧪 You're experimenting or prototyping
📚 You're building a learning project like a blog
🧰 You want full freedom and minimal abstraction
🧍 It's just you (solo dev), and performance isn’t the bottleneck
🧱 You're not dealing with thousands of requests per second
🧭 Your Current Project (Blog API)


Bottom line:
Flask is perfect for learning API design
It's modular and clean
It has rate limiting, auth, versioning
You’ve built Swagger docs via Flasgger

But once you…
Start working with async APIs,
Need faster response handling,
Or want to impress companies with typed endpoints and built-in docs…
👉 Then FastAPI becomes your next logical upgrade.
